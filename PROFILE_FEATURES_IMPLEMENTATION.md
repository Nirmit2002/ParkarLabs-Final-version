## Notes

1. **Profile Pictures**: Stored in filesystem at `backend/public/uploads/profiles/`
2. **Database Reference**: Only stores the path (e.g., `/uploads/profiles/user-1-123456.jpg`)
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Users without profile pictures show initials in colored circle
4. **Password Storage**: Uses `local_auth` table primarily, with fallback to `sessions` table
5. **Audit Logging**: All profile changes logged with timestamp and IP address

## Environment Variables
No new environment variables required. Uses existing:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (frontend)
- `JWT_SECRET` (backend)

## Dependencies
**Already Installed**:
- `multer@^1.4.5-lts.1` - File upload handling
- `bcryptjs@^2.4.3` - Password hashing

## Deployment Notes

1. Ensure uploads directory exists: `backend/public/uploads/profiles/`
2. Set proper permissions on uploads directory (writable by Node.js process)
3. Consider using cloud storage (S3, GCS) for production instead of filesystem
4. Ensure static file serving is configured in production web server
5. Set up regular cleanup of old/orphaned profile pictures if needed

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. Image cropping/resizing before upload
2. Multiple profile picture formats (avatar, cover photo)
3. Social media profile links
4. Bio/description field
5. Privacy settings for profile visibility
6. Profile picture history/gallery
7. Integration with cloud storage services
8. Automatic image optimization
